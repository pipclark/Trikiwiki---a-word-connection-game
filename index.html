      <li>The answer is a common English noun with a wikipedia page</li>
      <li>Enter a guess word to see what your guess has in common with the answer</li>
      <li>These are words linked to on both the wikipedia pages of the answer and the word you guessed</li>
      <li>Start anywhere and try to narrow it down with more guesses. If nothing appears here, there are no pages in common.</li>
      <li>Or you didn't enter a word with a wikiedia page. Check spelling!</li>
      <li>You can also click on words in the list to search. The answer could be among them.</li>
      <li>You will see if you get it right! It's Trikiwiki, so good luck.</li>
