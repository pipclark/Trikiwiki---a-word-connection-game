      <li>Find the hidden word! This is how:</li>
      <li>The answer is one of the most common nouns in English that has a wikipedia page</li>
      <li>Enter a guess word to see what your guess has in common with the answer</li>
      <li>These are words on both the wikipedia pages of the answer and the word you searched</li>
      <li>start anywhere and try to narrow it down with more guesses. If nothing appears here, there are no pages in common.</li>
      <li>You will see if you get it right! Note that the answer will change every 10 minutes if you refresh the page (don't refresh and it stays the same)</li>
      <li>It's Trikiwiki, so good luck.</li>
